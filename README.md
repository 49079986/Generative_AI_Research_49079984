**Abstract**

This study aims to explore the advantages and disadvantages of generative artificial intelligence (Generative AI) tools in academic, business, and daily life contexts. Through literature reviews, surveys, and interview analyses, the study finds that generative AI offers significant benefits in improving work efficiency, content creation, and data analysis. However, potential risks include issues with information accuracy, copyright and ethical concerns, and a possible over-reliance on human creativity. The study suggests that clear guidelines and regulations should be established when using generative AI to balance technological innovation with social responsibility.
